# `RangeSet`

Simple structure for storing set of Elixir's ranges.

## Set operations (existing and planned)

- [x] `Enumberable`
- [x] `RangeSet.difference/2`
- [x] `RangeSet.gaps/1`
- [x] `RangeSet.intersection/2`
- [x] `RangeSet.union/2`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `range_set` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
